# Broker_Wallet
Simple LDB plugin for World of Warcraft that displays and tracks info from the character currency tab.

This addon will do 2 things:

1. Display on the tooltip the contents of your character's currency tab.

2. Use the default WoW currency tracker to track up to 3 chosen currencies.

 

Broker_Wallet does not provide it's own display, you will need a LDB-based display addon, such as ChocolateBar, NinjaPanel, Titan, etc. Addon may work with Classic Vanilla and BC but is untested.

Special thanks to Torhal and Arkayenro. Extra special thanks to Curseforge user fresh_meatz for fixing the 9.0 errors.

 

***Updated for Shadowlands patch 9.2.7***
